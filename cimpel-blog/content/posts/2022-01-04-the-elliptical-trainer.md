Alan training

After three days of regeneration, I started training yesterday

I'm a bit short of time because you have to change the water meter and I want to train first.

Quickly through the app, I enter the program and start.

I'm surprised, after five minutes I look at the display and can't think of anything.

I mistakenly entered the Weight Loss program at this rate, but I am not changing it.

The machine takes turns adding and removing the load, it's a nice change of pace and it looks like the load is gradually increasing.

After 20 minutes I am very busy and in the room I start to smell the delicious smell of roast duck….

"Who Bakes a Duck on Tuesday"? I tell myself and then I find out that it's because of smelling my burning fat ...

"What's going on !!!! Instead of shit, my fat flows ...

I'm starting to get unusually hungry and can't swallow too much saliva because I have a brutal predilection for duck ...

The machine is increasing the load inexorably and for the last five minutes it's so hard work my belly fat is starting to burn normally like popcorn in the microwave which is amazing, I can't believe my eyes ... there is an intense smell of fried food Duck all over the apartment ...

I'm finishing my workout and looking for a bag with a new dietary supplement to use as an after-workout shower head.

It is a gift from a friend who gave it to me with the words "It's in a class of its own after training, it's very okay".

Because of the time, I don't work it with water, I immediately pour it into a mouth full of saliva (the artisans may come at any moment).

The contents of the bag are mixed with saliva and I have never seen such strong sowing as if you throw a menthos into a bottle of Coca Cola.

The foam is growing in volume quickly, I close my mouth but the bitch has found her way and is starting to squirt out of my nose ... I open my mouth to release the pressure but the foam is growing in volume and me I'm like a foam fire extinguisher ...

I run to the bathroom so that the whole room doesn't stick from the foam, but on the way I inhaled the damn foam, so I almost choke, cough, inject, stand safely in the hallway and lean forward to catch my breath and wipe the damn foam from my mouth and nose. ..

Someone knocks ... "Crafts what now"? I can't let her go so I open the door on the forward turn ...

When the masters notice me, one of them yells "What's wrong with you" and promptly opens the door, which hits me and throws me to the ground ...

Handyman enters the apartment and the first thing you see is me lying on the floor with foam in my mouth ...

The older man yells "I will save you", he quickly runs up to me and tries to get me into an anti-shock or some other position while the younger one searches the net for something ...

"Shit, but it slips, I think it's covered with ointment" (that's the grease mentioned) says the older man and shakes my hand behind my back and tries to tilt my head ... I can't at this speed react and I can't even defend myself ...

"His tongue must be pulled out," shouted the winning disciple ...

The older man presses my jaw firmly and shoves his fingers in my mouth, tries to grab my tongue and pull it out ...

The taste of his fingers was disgusting (he probably didn't wash his hands on the toilet) but I could feel the taste of mushrooms, cottage cheese and Swedish fermented herring "sustromming", at that moment I clenched my teeth and vomited ....

"AAAAAAAA bit me, elder complains, now what ???

The younger man immediately checked the internet that I probably had a concussion with my symptoms, but he says "pulling out the tongue is important so that he doesn't suffocate, he has to break my jaw and pull my tongue out by force, fix it" with it it won't fall off !!! "

I wanted to scream "what's the matter with you, stop it" but I just let out a throaty throat ...

The older man is already breaking my jaw, but luckily I noticed it and preferred to stick my tongue out with a delicious herring ...

“You don't bite me anymore,” says the older one and catches my tongue with a pair of pliers, squeezes it properly and then pierces it with a thin screwdriver with a sharp movement of the hand

"We won't let him die" shouts the older man ...
