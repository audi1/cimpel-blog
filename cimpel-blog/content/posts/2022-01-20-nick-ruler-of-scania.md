Nick sat in his new glass palace, his hairless head shining brightly in the sun!\
His wig with beautiful hair, which he loved so proudly swam in the lake, threw it there at night Cimpel ...\
The situation is serious, He called a battle meeting of his best heroes!

\
Shadow also came first with his eight copies, and Nick handed him Brazerr shakily. Shadow drank and asked, "You really want to fight Cimpel"?\
Nick was pensive, he didn't want to fight, he was very sorry for yesterday, he said it in alcohol intoxication ...\
The "Three Sisters" of the once feared warriors arrived. In the first conflicts, DD plundered enemy tiles and burned cities, but today they are older menopausal women who prefer to sit at home and hack beautiful tablecloths ...

\
The glass palace door opened and Sven and Hunk came down, shouting "BOJ" in unison.\
Nick looked up and said vigorously, you two can certainly chop the wood, this is not stealing 9s of tiles, Cimpel is a dreaded fighter and his APC are deadly !!!\
"Finally"! exclaimed Nick, in the distance he saw his best hero "Death Rider" coming.\
"WTF" ??? where is my horse, why does it ride on donkeys ??? ”He shouted in fear.

\
Nick knew that in recent months he had only devoted himself to building a glass palace in which he had invested all his resources ...\
"How are we doing with CE research" ??? "We have just discovered the wheel" the scientists replied with fear ...\
Get APC to look at them, but his Scania were in service ...\
"I should have bought a Volvo," Nick sighed, knowing he had to apologize !!!\
"And finally get the toilet plumber out of my head, I look like an idiot with him !!!\
He put it on his head with fun at night, Cimpel, when he came to Scania to talk to his longtime friend Nick. Well, the toilet plumber kept there under vacuum until now, and Nick couldn't prove it to himself!<!--StartFragment-->

The sun sets over the lake and Scania's landscape slowly plunges into darkness.\
Nick was still sitting in the Glass Palace, thinking about the last days.\
"What can I do to defend the power of Cimpel's APCs?" He began to despair, not thinking clearly ...\
His Scientists made him very angry! "Wheel, we researched the wheel" ??? The whole world has known the wheel for 3000 years! We are all over the world laughing and with the whole wheel ....\
"Fuck, fuck, think, you have to have a solution!"\
"Where the hell are the Three Sisters? We have a combat meeting\
 "Today is Wednesday, BIngo have a night at a nursing home," Shadow replied fearfully.\
It's my Death Rider, Nick smiled. "Where is your war horse, why does it ride on donkeys, it looks ridiculous ???"\
Nick asked angrily.\
"My head is spinning, it's high, the donkey suits me better, last time I took the shelves from Ikea on the donkey, it's a multifunctional animal," said DR.\
"At least you have a gas mask it looks rough"! Nick teased him\
"I have a gas mask for all cat allergies, if I don't have a gas mask then I sneeze all day, my eyes itch"! replied DR\
"Oh my god, we're like a traveling circus, we don't have a chance to defend ourselves against Cimpel's."\
The silence was broken by the huge noise of the engines, Shadow peered out of fear!\
“WTF Shadow? It's just a Volvo tractor towing our Scania trucks and garages, they can't start it "\
"Oh my god, we're like a traveling circus, we don't have a chance to defend ourselves against Cimpel's."\
Suddenly he noticed a boat in the distance on the lake, and a mysterious figure stood on the boat.\
"Charon is coming for me" ??? Nick cried

<!--EndFragment--><!--StartFragment-->

The mysterious figure on the boat looked like it was sailing on a blazing lake full of lava in the setting rays of the sun.\
Nick swallowed hard, put the gold coin for Charon in his pocket, put on his helmet, which had two swaying deer dicks instead of horns, and took a shield and a large double-sided ax in his hands. He knew that the last fight was coming, and as soon as the sun was setting today, he would drink beer with Scania's ancient heroes in the Great Hall of Valhalla and tell stories from the fighting!\
"Mr. Skanie doesn't give his life for free!" Nick shouted, but immediately stopped, "where are all my heroes when I need them?"\
Shadow sat on the ground in a pool of urine, holding his head and crying. The three sisters have not yet returned from Bingo dinner because they still had a photo shoot on the billboards, advertising diapers for urine leakage. They had to make some money because they no longer took part in the fighting! The Death Rider tried terribly mounted on his roaring donkey, but he couldn't because the glasses on his gas mask fogged up and he saw nothing!\
Nick shook his head in disbelief "This is not true" across the courtyard, Cimpel arrives, a flaming sword in hand and the relentless look of a killer !\
Nick ran toward Cimpel, raised his shield with his left hand to protect him, and drove the Axes powerfully against Cimpel.\
He brilliantly dodged the attack and strike his flaming sword into Nick's shield. The fire blinded Nick for a moment and suddenly caused him to lose his balance. Nick deftly released the flaming shield and gripped the ax tightly in both hands. He deftly uncovered Cimpel's quick lunges and reached the Cimpel's back with a brisk jump. Nick wanted to end the fight with a quick hitting of the ax on Cimpel's unprotected back and split Cimpel in two. But Cimpel deftly dodged and measured Nick and his fighting stance. Nick became firmly focused on the next blow. The deer's cock on the helmet moved wildly from side to side right in front of Nick's eyes\
"Fuck what do you have on your head?" Cimpel asked with a laugh. "Put it down, you look funny in that helmet.\
"Those cocks will lose their erection years ago, since then I only have the helmet for fun," Nick said, dropping the helmet ...\
\
"Btw you used to be a faster mate," Cimpel said, dropping his flaming sword and spreading his arms.\
"We're getting old, bro," Nick said, releasing his ax breathlessly and hugging Cimpel hard.\
"I'm glad you're here, the boat is approaching on the lake, raise your sword and let's greet her! Nick smiled, glad that his faithful friend managed to come and help him in difficult times.\
Cimpel took the flaming sword, Nick the ax, and they both went to the pier to greet the mysterious figure floating on the boat.\
"WTH, BC, Fuck, but you scared us, what the fuck are you doing here and why are you coming alone on a boat?"\
Nick asked when he met BC getting out of the boat.\
Dark clouds are rising over the islands of Avalon, I urgently need your help friends, no time to explain, you will learn everything along the way.\
You will find out what the problems are on the islands of Avalon and how it will all end in another of the stories from the island of Avalon.
