WSQ stood on the steps to look more majestic and began to recap the year 2021!
She awarded honors to veterans of the Battle of the Devil's Gorge, and praised the greatest warriors of present-day Eden, who will still receive their rewards. She evaluated the migration to 554 and thanked the new members for trust and strengthening hMB!
After the speech, she raised her cup and opened big celebrations with a toast!
After the speech, the banquet turned up, only the best dishes from all over the world were eaten, and the alcohol service barely managed to replenish them.
Groups began to form and cheerful communication and entertainment began.
DJ Oberpfalzer played the biggest hits and the dance floor was immediately filled with dancing!

After hours of celebrations, when most of the guests were intoxicated, Rocksolid ran into the hall, completely naked.


At a closer look, Olivia noticed a big carrot stick out of his ass! A very angry chef runs after him and vigorously grabs the carrot and pulls it out of Rock's ass !!!
Rock just whispers "please do it again, it was amazing" !!!
At that moment, Olivia's whip whistles and hits Rock exactly on the back, "what's that supposed to mean, who let you?" screams Olivia. "I'm Wild Dingo, the carrot was in the hand of the hare I ate"! Rock answers with a smile, unaware of the gravity of the situation.


"Until the end of the celebrations, you will lie naked and make a table and food will be served on you"! Olivia showed
Rock remained motionless and waited for what would follow, but the servants immediately placed a few seafood specialties on him.
Most of the evening, everyone avoided this strange table, only HansPeter, a great gourmet, bravely approached and started tasting. "Those scallops are awessome an urgent need for a recipe for my chef," Hans said, eating the whole bowl with great gusto.
"Rodon come here, the food is amazing," Haans called to Rodon.
Rodon approached uncertainly, picked up the gold fork, and carefully pushed Rock's large kangaroo tail away to reach the Takifugu fish specialties.
Cimpel arrived at the party a little late, he had an urgent mission to complete. He looked around the hall for a long time to find the people he was looking for.
He stepped forward and stopped at the first table, where Bavarian Princess Anna sat on Stojd's knees  and taught him to yodel. There were about 30 empty beer glasses on the table in front of them. Cimpel arrived and asked Stojda what they were doing. "I lost the competition to drink beer so I have to yodel" and started making strange noises. Anny stalls his testicles with his hand so that his voice gets the desired height ...
Cimpel smiled and apologized and walked away.
Freedom and Kaye danced in the middle of the dance floor, their dance creation was magical, they had perfect rhythm and delicious movements, their bodies intertwined in perfect harmony while taking their breath away.
Cimpel pay attention for a moment, nodding his head gently in greeting, but he had responsibilities, unable to join the dance.
He walked on next to the tables, at the next table sat the elite commanders, the Great Warriors: DS Tommy, Viper, MVXMVX, DonkiBenee. She loudly told stories from the last battles, they solved the strategy and the compilation of the APC, They were the hammer of hMB, which broke many enemy bases!

At the next table sat our friends with Avalon, King Erik eagerly asked Cimpel "Do you have it for me ???"
Cimpel nodded in agreement, " what are you doing, where are your clothes?" Cimpel asked curiously.
"This is the latest fashion from Andersen, it will be a big hit of the ball season," replied King Eric.
Floppy and Baccon shouted at once, "Cimple sit down, we have great English beer, good gin and we're telling our stories from the forest!"
"I'm friends with you for a while, I just have to say something surprisingly," said the departing Cimpel.
He finally found the person he was looking for, BC dressed in a Marshal uniform, with a glass of the best gin in one hand and a Marsal scepter in the other behind his back, arguing decently with Dreemer, trying not to look at her big boobs.
Cimpel approached them, leaned over BC, and began to say something important to him. Bc nodded in agreement, a smile on his face. “Magnificent everything fit together, the puzzle is complete! by the way, we are sitting in the back by the fireplace, I'll be right there, I'm waiting for you, "BC told Cimpel.
Cimpel walked over to the back table, where Nick, the ruler of Scania, Thor, a feared, once-feared warrior who had exchanged his sword for a plow, was now only ist a farmer.
Nick noticed saw Cimpel coming.
"WTF how dare you," Nick said haughtily, standing up!"Once again, I'm wondering how dare you delay a friend like that?" Nick asked, hugging Cimpel happily.
"We're starting to get nervous," everything's ready, "Nick asked.
Cimpel nodded "instructions will tell you BC," Cimpel said in one breath, and quickly drank his beer.
"What the fuck stinks here, who's fucked here?" Cimpel asked nervously
"It's just our herring, which we brought to the beer party, they're delicious," Nick clarified the situation.
"Why don't you entertain Fels?" WSQ asked "throw away your worries and have fun"
However, Felsa was not in the mood for fun "my cock hurts and I have a big bruise on it, I'm not feeling well" Felsa said sadly.
"What the hell happened to my dear Fels?" WSQ asked carefully
"I was in the bathroom and, as I'm used to, I started working with a helicopter's cock, but an energetic 130-pound cleaner came to the toilets and hit me on the cock with a huge palm blow, as if she was killing a snake and screaming that she finally caught the phantom who still soils the mirror with drops of urine! ”said Felsa, pouring more ice into his crotch.
"Auuuuuuuu, the Auditor and Iceman shouted at the same time, and they began to choke on laughter. They sat next to the Queen so they heard the whole story.
For about an hour, they've been hand pushing for each other to find out who the Canadian is, it's probably their national sport, right after hockey. They were both as strong as bears, and the Auditor's hands were made of steel, intensified by the constant manipulation of maple syrup barrels.
Iceman was a hunter, a killer of grizzly bears, to which he only used a knife with a knife, so far successfully!
WSQ was nervous, her faithful friend Felsa wasn't okay, she didn't like BC secrets and especially the arrogant Cimpel was having fun at the table with Nick. Este still hadn't forgotten that he called her garage jewel "Barbie a car," but the peace of the  was she didn't want to make a new conflict and bring old guilt to light!
You will soon find out how the heroes will start the new year and how the Nordic saga will end and the stories with Avalon in the next Hero's story from the Diamond Table.
