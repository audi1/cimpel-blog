In the gloomy cold early morning, the first rays of the sun illuminated the HmB camp located behind a high mountain range forming the natural border of the north.  north icy wind swept through the camp and the flapping tents and alliance flags fluttered rhythmically.
There was a strong smell of coffee in the camp.
Cimpel came out of his tent wrapped in a bear fur and sat down by the fire, poured himself a mug of strong black coffee and stared into the fire.
"What the hell happened yesterday?" he replayed flashes of yesterday's day in his mind
"Everything was precisely planned, yesterday's big offensive pushed the enemy and we should have gained one or two accesses to the ancient gates, which would have opened the way to the WC. But suddenly the shield wall fell, was it sabotage of the enemy agent in our camp, or just bad timing???" We were all under a lot of pressure, a mistake happened and we started a massive evacuation instead of a vital route. We did not give away our skin cheaply, it was a managed coordinated retreat at the cost of great sacrifices. Many of us sacrificed and their bases slowed down the enemy! But the thrust of the enemy's attack was so strong that their bases crumbled like houses made of cards." Cimpel recalled and took a sip of hot coffee. "Wow, amazing coffee, so tasty and that aroma," said Cimpel.
"It's a real Venezuelan Motebello from the mountainous region of the state of Táchira, I roasted it myself this morning, mi Hermano," said Zeo with pride. "Thanks bro, I haven't drunk beter yet" Cimpel thanked.
"My brother, why are you so sad and do you have tears in your eyes?" Cimpel asked Zeo, "the fucking smoke from the fire got into my eyes, pendejo" Zeo finally smiled and rubbed his eyes with his hands.
"Look around, the whole camp is sad, we had high expectations and the season went to shit, it's over." Zeo stated. Cimpel looked around and really saw his friends they are watching the fire with bowed heads, he saw sadness, disappointment, fatigue on their faces... Only Lethal was running from fire to fire and selling some home-made pottery. Lene stood sadly in front of her tent and gazed into the distance at the high mountains and thought. Lene this little Napoleon said to herself "No, this won't be my Waterloo!!!!" she thought, and new plans of attacks began to form in her head. When she saw Cimpel and the others by the fire, she decided to follow them, when she came "Hello my dear friends" she said and sat by the fire with a smile. "God save the queen!" said the everyone in unison.
"This will cheer you up" Zeo said with a smile and handed the White Sausage Queen Lene a cup of hot coffee. "What good are you cooking on that fire" asked WSQ Lene. "those are Chimchulines, a great treat" said Burzum, taking a sip from his Mate.
"Lene you bleed " screamed Issie, this fearless son of Atlas, a feared warrior and a good tracker.
"I don't have time to bleed now," said Lene, "now she opened up to me a still unhealed old wound, during the great defense of the city, an enemy arrow hit me right in the kidney, but I'm already out of the worst." Lene added in one breath. “Oh yes our magnificent city defenses!” Issie recalled “and our unpredictable assaults on bridges, towns and fortifications” added Terrible Terry. "It really wasn't a bad season, friends, looking back, we enjoyed it," Felsa pointed out.
Cimpel took out a piece of bloody paper "I found this letter yesterday on the battlefield when the shield wall fell.

My beloved


I'm writing you these lines because I don't know if we'll meet again. The shield wall has just fallen and the enemy APCs are rushing to our positions, I am in the front line and I have to hold back the incoming enemies!!! I could teleport and come to you my beloved love, but I can't because I'm HmB and I wouldn't be able to live knowing that I ran away and had my HmB brothers massacred!!! So now I have to organize my APC and give my great friends and brothers in arms time to evacuate! I want you to know, my beloved, that I will go into my last fight with a smile and I will joyfully defend the evacuation of my brothers from HmB, and I want you to know that my last thought before I meet God will be about you!!!
I already wrote to you in previous letters that we had a great season, yes, we had many defeats and the enemy pushed us to our basic borders, but we also had successful attacks and decimated the enemy's bases, stole their cities and bridges. That's what Eden is about, sometimes you win, sometimes you lose, but the fact that I can fight with great people and my brothers in arms under the banner of the HmB guild is the main thing!!! There is always good fun in the camp, we laugh a lot and help each other and make sacrifices for each other.
we are simply a family and a family sticks together even in difficult times!!!

The enemy has just reached the gates of my base, I don't know how long I can last, reinforcements are on the way and it's time to defend the retreat path for my HmB family with sword and determination!”
I hope you understand, my beloved.
With love Yours ....

Cimpel read the letter with tears in his eyes.
"Oh that's beautifully written, who wrote it?" asked WSQ Lene, moved
"The blood on the paper dissolved the ink, so we'll never know," said Cimpel with regret, "but the unknown hero is right, he got HmB right, we are family and family sticks together no matter how bad the season is, we always stick together!!! Cimpel added.
"Carve the words in that letter in stone!" added Felsa "we had a lot of fun, made new friendships and that's for life!"
"You're right friends, keep your head up, our fight is not over yet, let's defend our cities and make the end of Eden unpleasant for the enemy, so that they will always know that HmB are not cowards who run away from the fight!" said WSQ Lene, now in a fighting mood
Loud singing suddenly began to be heard from Tabor. "That letter really motivated and opened our hearts," added Issie with a smile.
"Oh no, it's just Any, Big Sveny and a bunch of Teutonic knights have been drinking beer since yesterday and now they've also got the taste to sing" said Lene with a laugh
Everyone around the fire started to laugh and there was no trace of the bad mood.
This is exactly what HmB is all about, friends!!!!!
