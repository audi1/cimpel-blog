WSQ and its R4 advisors have been working on a perfect attack plan since last morning. They took into account every variable, its German precision and attention to detail eventually created a formidable military operation.
Everything was surgically accurate! It has to be the perfect plan to attack the two gates.
She pushed the plan for the Line and a great migration of nations and bases began, everyone had a fixed position, but as is often the case, there was real chaos in the move!
Great warriors like Tommy, Viper, MVXIMVS, knew their place at the Upper Gate, moved their bases right in front of the ancient gate separating the two worlds!
 Support forces led by Olivia moved across the river, were protected and could attack from a distance.
"OH Rock, I miss your cock, Olivia whispered quietly" she was nervous and longed for Rock's strong embrace and especially she wanted to feel them in hes Huge kangaroo tail ...
Rock had a lot of work this time with guiding the ever-coming basics!
The upper yellow gate was assigned to a seasoned veteran with hMB, there the Hammer was to hit the hardest !!!
The lower purple was intended for our new but already proven allies from the extreme rising sun, the Australian light cavalry and other friendly vassals, under the cover of darkness our faithful ally WOD prepared the way from the other side, prepared for a rapid collapse and creating confusion in our attack on the yellow gate!

It is a deep night, the full moon illuminates both camps, the mysterious Slovan Cimpel stands on a rock alcove above the battlefield, watching the hundreds of thousands of fires burning in the camps. He is waiting for the last orders before the fight, but is being called to the Winter Palace for instructions. It quietly enters the main hall where it is very busy! All commanders stand around a diamond-shaped table in the shape of a large vagina, which symbolizes the birth of hMB.
Lene gives vigorous instructions and moves the figures around the map, the Commanders nod at the sign of understanding sieves!
Felsa arrives The first traveler and lord of scrolls and shouts "we have a big problem, in Eden a new powerful magic gives APC incredible strength, and from 140,000 troops in one line APC and other dark things!"
"Why do I know until now?" Lene shouted, how are our APCs doing with this dark magic? "
Looking at the ground, Felsa replied, "I managed to create a powerful spell with the help of old scrolls and rare earths, and I have this dark research at 88% and the other heroes also have something," he said frightenedly.
"God protect us!" Said WSQ. "God protect us WSQ!"
"Everyone to the their places!" WSQ ordered
23:50 GT there was a grave silence at the bases. WSQ took the lead in the armies and delivered a memorable voice: "Enjoy the silence, thats over tomorows!"
It's time for rituals before the attack, everyone had their own, someone prayed to the old gods, others sang fighting songs , Rocksolid energetically masturbated .
"It will be a new battle of nations" WSQ whispered to Cimpel, who was waiting for a signal by her side ...
23:59:40 GT, Tomb's silence was broken by thunder drumming and trumpeting!
00:00 GT Gate according to the old prophecy has lost its defensive shields!
VV2 sent all its APCs to the gate, they wanted to take it in one attack.
The first eager APC moved in the hMB camp.
"Not yet, stop !!!" Lene shouted
The gate under the VV2 crack cracked, but still held
The second wave of VV2 apc attack quickly rushed to the goal.
Other impatient hMB commanders sent their apc
"Not yet, stop !!!" shouted the furious WSQ, "but VV2 will take the gate like this and we're lost" someone whispered fearfully
"Trust your queen!" Shouted Bacon vigorously, "whoever disobeys himself will execute himself in the nearest tree !!!"
The second wave of the VV2 attack damaged the gate quite badly, but the powerful gate built by ancient civilizations still held.

"ATAAAAAAAAAAAACK !!!" WSQ will command and the revs of thousands of hMB engines frightened the enemy for a while, thus giving WSQ time for the final attack on the goal
APC hMB were rapidly approaching the gate, the ground shook, the enemy squinted, and looked in fear toward the gate.
We don't know who hit the gate first, but the joint timed hMB hammer blow was so extremely powerful that the gate disintegrated into thousands of small fragments that blinded the enemy.
The enemy tried to escape in panic, but not everyone succeeded in the scum and fear, leaving Tommy, Viper, Felsa and the others tearing the bases to pieces. Freedom flew around the battlefield and dealt severe blows, at times it seemed to fly over the battlefield like the myth of Valkyrie and take the enemy to Valhalla.
She smelled blood, and it awakened her other self, a beast craving for killing. "
The enemy's premortal cry and cry gave her strength and determination,
After a few minutes it was after the fight, but WSQ did not allow enlightenment celebrate
"We have to stick to the plan, we need to get the city and it's a long way through enemy territory." She said vigorously
The first rays of the sun brightened the world and revealed the night massacre ... and in daylight the first apc approached the CITY
"It will not be an easy attack, we are in enemy territory and you can see us from a distance," WSQ told her commanders.
"Spread around the city and from the support behind the gate we will occupy the city.
The first attacks of the defenders were surprised and the city shook in its foundations, but during the next attack, fresh defensive apc came to the city and VV2 sent a strong counterattack from the left wing.
The floppy, fortunately, noticed him in time and confronted himself with dozens of enemy APCs to gain time for hMB and the siege of the city.
He easily repulsed the first attacks, his apc knew what to do, and Floppy held a protective net over the city's occupation.
But APC VV2 came in waves and the Floppy began to lose a lot of troops.
The legendary attack Battle of Helms Deep in LOTR was just a tea party, as opposed to attack which Floppy had to resist. But he knew he had to wait another minute for hMB to recharge the city.
The last weeks of his life in the woods had strengthened him, and he cleared his head there.
He gave brilliant orders to the defensive apc, regularly replenished the lines, but cracks began to form in his defensive walls and the enemy penetrated as much as possible through the back door, if he did not want to lose everything he had to retreat but the hMB attack already managed to occupy the city.
The floppy retreated with honor, and the enemy, driven out of the city's loss, directed its APC at the Viper, but its Jack O Neil-class Azgard battleship frightened and amazed the enemy APC, so it struck at full speed on the BC's leading base. The first attack was stopped by Cimpel, but there were hundreds of them who could not manage.
Hmb sent reinforcements to the APC as a priority for BC and they resisted for a long time, but the enemy launched "Kraken"
Apc endowed with new magic that Felsa talked about !!!
During the attack, the Kraken cut the BC base into two halves and broke through 10 defensive APCs.
BC did not get scared, resumed the troops in the APC and hMB sent more support, but the magical beast Kraken struck again and the onslaught could no longer be sustained, the base disintegrated and only ruins remained ...
hMB today has achieved a legendary victory in the new battle of nations, you will find out how the military procession in Eden will continue in the next regular story of the Friends from the diamond table ...
I apologize if I forgot about someone in the story, it was a fact a lot and everyone has my great respect and recognition for today's performances ... Thank you my friends !!!
