description: One story from different people's point of view
---
Burzum woke up to warning trumpets, shouts and the ringing of bells. He jumped out of bed and, still sleepy, ran to the terrace of his apartment.
"Shit, why are you making so much noise? I will have you executed. Who started this combat readiness exercise?" shouted Burzum from the terrace.
"El Patron, this is not an exercise, the enemy is approaching, we are surrounded!!!"
Burzum was amazed and in the clouds of dust he really saw the approaching enemy APCs burning the ground and approaching fast. "Puta, puta, puta madre, Zeo i hate you! Ooo Zeo, cabron, you told me yesterday, move down to the river, it's quiet, there's a nice view of the river and the ancient gate beyond the river, and above all , there are rich tile pastures." Burzum recalled yesterday's conversation with Zeo
"I knew I couldn't go here, there are a lot of mosquitoes by this fucking river and today we are already under attack." Lamented Burzum "hey Cabrones, start the defense protocol, everyone to your positions, charge all apc with T10, we will win this battle and the enemy will see that Burzum has a big cohones."
The defense managed the first enemy attacks brilliantly with minimal losses, Burzum directed the defenders with a smile, arranged the APC in formation, everything was still going according to his ideas.
"You just have to hold on for a while, help is on the way and we will scatter the enemy on the battlefield" shouted Burzum in a good mood with a glass of fresh mare's milk in his hand.
Suddenly the ground shook and Burzum was covered in mare's milk "WTH Maze just ported to the middle of the fighting? Oh, does that bitch want to steal all our glory, or did she just come to help us in the fight?" Burzum pondered. "Actually, it doesn't matter, there's enough glory and kills for everyone," Burzum laughed out loud.
"LAILA MAX legendary half-male, half-female enemy with 15G kills is leading the charge against us! We're all going to die here!" shouted a frightened Aceki from a nearby base.
"Puta, puta puta puta, hijos de puta, if we are to be defeated, then with all that goes with it and with great glory." Burzum shouted and went to put on his ceremonial armor.
In blue armor with white belts and with the Yellow Sun on his chest, Burzum mounted his horse, took his long bull-slaying spear into his hand and signaled to the defenders guarding the main gate to open it.
When the main gate of his base opened, he launched a counterattack with his group of loyal riders!!!
â€œATTAAAAAAAAAAACKKKKK!!!!! He shouted and during a fast gallop he started to sing loudly: Don't cry for me, Argentina
The truth is, I never left you
All through my wild days, my mad existence
I kept my promise
Don't keep your distance
And as for fortune, and as for fame
I never invited them in
Although it seemed to the world they were all I desired
They are illusions, they are not the solutions they promised to be
The answer was here all the time
I love you, and I hope you love me
Don't cry for me, Argh...
A terrible blow threw Burzum off his horse, during the fall he last saw how his base was shaking in its foundations, first his walls collapsed with a terrible cloud and in a wave of dust and smoke, his beloved base also collapsed like a house of cards... .
Maze, the princess of Hamburg, the port guard, woke up and enjoyed her favorite hot bath after a light breakfast. She threw off her robe and slowly slipped into the bath full of foam and essential oils. She loved the feeling when the warm water gently caressed her velvety skin and her body relaxed perfectly. After an hour of lying in the bath, she began to wash her flexible body very carefully, first with circular movements she was washing her firm breasts, gently stroking her nipples with the fingers of her left hand and very slowly approaching her crotch with her right hands. "Oh I feel the fine hairs" Maze was shocked, she immediately took her sharp dagger and started to depilate her long sexy legs.


"Dagger, why are you going to shave with a dagger??? Only hot wax will guarantee that your body will be perfectly smooth, use hot wax!!!" shouted Sunshine (Oh sorry, that's another story)


But suddenly she was interrupted by a pleasant voice "Princess Your Excellency, the work on your Teleport is finished, but we have to sound the alarm, the enemy has attacked the tiles around the teleport, we have to send an APC from afar to defend the tiles and friends" Maze is an experienced commander, she has fought hundreds of battles even she didn't look up from depilating her legs and promptly gave the orders to mobilize the forces, fill the APCs, and bring her Black Gold-Rimmed Armor .
"Are you still here???" Maze asked and finally looked at the messenger. "It's you Cimpel? doing here, why didn't my servants deliver the news?" Maze asked and slowly stood up.
"Yes. I have come to strengthen the defenses and to accompany the evacuation to your safe zone Princess." Cimpel answered, watching the drops of water run down her shoulders, over her tight bosom and down the Princess's gorgeous body,
"Are you here to evacuation? Do you like what you see?" Maze asked, lightly moistening her lips with her tongue and running the tips of the cold steel dagger incredibly slowly over her body. "Come to me!" Princess Maze commanded. Cimpel swallowed hard and walked unsteadily to a large barrel of hot steaming water where Princess Maze stood like the goddess Aphrodite emerging from the waves of the sea.
The princess grabbed his hand, gave him her sharp dagger, and whispered playfully into his ear.
"Cimpel, you interrupted my depilation, now I want you to shave me down there so I'm nice and smooth!" and she ran her hand over her pussy and spread her legs slightly.
Cimpel first ran his hand gently over the pussy and then with the precise movements of the steel blade he adjusted the Princess's Pussy beautifully and smoothly.
"Now check if my body is completely smooth!" Maze pointed out, "I want to be sure to go into battle nicely groomed, fragrant and perfectly smooth so that I look good at the event in Valhalla.
Cimpel started caressing the smooth legs of the was approaching and slowly approached Pussy. Maze was very excited by the touch of Cimpel's strong hands as he slowly stroked her legs up and down. Maze began to breathe excitedly, moan softly, and her hips began to move uncontrollably. She grabbed Cimpel's hand and quickly moved to her wet pussy.
At that the ground trembled, it seemed as if the walls of the palace would collapse at any moment.
"Oh yes, yes yes, yeeeeee," exclaimed an uncontrollably excited Maze. During the rhythmic movements of Cimpel's hand, the Princess's body was filled with such strong excitement and pleasure that in a millisecond it exploded into a terrible intense orgasm!. Exactly one second after the terrible orgasm, her palach teleported to the center of the biggest fights, immediately led by Burzum...


"WTH Maze just ported to the middle of the fights? Oh, does that bitch want to steal all our glory, or did she just come to help us in the fight?" Burzum pondered when he saw how Maze had just teleported. "Actually, it doesn't matter, there's enough glory and kills for everyone" Burzum laughed out loud.

Maze immediately started to get dressed in armor, but there was no time, so she only pulled on black leather pants that perfectly highlighted her sexy ass and long legs, and she quickly pulled on her gold-lined leather breastplate, took her famous sword and shield, and she rushed to the courtyard, the king was already preparing her favorite war horse, Hugephallus.
"Thank you honey, I'll do it to you after the battle" she winked at Cimpel and immediately added "What's standing there so idly, it's battle time, glory can't wait:" Meze said, mischievously winked at Cimpel and hurried to land on her Hugephallus. As the gates of her palace opened, Maze charged into battle on horseback in the front line. Her Huge phallus stood on the bottom and its extremely large dick was exposed to the enemy.

"WTH, what does that mean, what does that horse want to do???" shouted the warriors in the first enemy formation in horror. "o No o no, I don't want to get under that action, it would hurt a lot" they shouted and in panic fear the enemies started to leave their formations.
Maze, as a rider of doom, mowed down enemy formations for hours, and Laila Max, a half-man and half-woman, hit her base with such force that the sky would collapse on her....
Maze slowly opened her eyes and the bright light and intense heat all over her body, "Am I in heaven?" she asked.
"No Your Highness, we are in the desert, the ruins of our base were moved right next to Burzum, now you have to rest:" Maze closed her eyes and slept with the idea of how her erotic story with the sexy, hot, athletic Cimpel would continue to develop.

"Dagger, why are you shaving with a dagger??? Only hot wax will guarantee that your body will be perfectly smooth, use hot wax!!!" shouted Sunshine, dropping her phone on the ground and clutching her head.
"Fuck, why don't those European bastards try hot waxing, it's perfect, I've been doing it since I was twelve years old" said Karen and picked up the fallen phone. She sat comfortably, took a glass of red wine in her hand and went back to reading Cimpel's story, she was his big fan.
"OMG, I can't believe it, Cimpel, is Cimpel there and he's going to shave Maze Pussy?"" she commented in disbelief and with excitement on the events of Sunshine's story.
"Well, it's about time, that brilliant writer with a sexy tanned body finally indulged in a bit of eroticism, OMG it's here it's here, Cimpel and Maze are going to have some really wild sex today" Karen was looking forward, "I have to call Zombie right away, no no no, I'll read it first and have a good time with them" thought Sunshine and took a drink of red wine to relax."Oh yes, oh yes Cimpel, take good care of her Pussy, let it be smooth like mine after depilation with hot wax.
Sunshine looked around the house, she was alone, Uter still improved something on the APC in the garage. At the scene where Cimpel is checking with her hand whether Maze is perfectly smooth, Sunshine was overcome by a wave of excitement and involuntarily slipped her hand to her crotch to preemptively check whether she was also pretty smooth. "Uter, Uter where are you? I have something for you right now, you don't understand, I'm going to do it myself without you, I can't wait anymore.....
Zombie saw a message from Sunshine on her phone "Cimpel has a new story, you have to read it right away" Zombie eagerly and excitedly finished the story "OMG, OMG, this is so wonderful, I hope it will continue,, Sunshine, I have to call Sunshine. Wait, I'll call later, now I have to try something" she screamed excitedly, took a kitchen knife and ran out into the yard to a large barrel for rainwater.....
"Pfff, it's impossible to tell what that Cimpel thinks about himself," angrily Lene put the phone on the couch. "I'll probably kick him out of the alliance, this is downright rude what he writes, such offensive articles do not belong in the alliance chat. Lena said in disgust and immediately went to call Felsa to support her in liquidating Cimpel.
