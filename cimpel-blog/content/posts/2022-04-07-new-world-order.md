Yes, today is the big day when Cimpel uses 968 tickets to get the full Glowblade and Thunderbolt. Achieving these two heroes would mean a shift in Slovakia among the LSS superpowers. People in the squares prayed, some Slovaks decided to go to places of pilgrimage and pray there for Cimpel's success. The newsrooms from all over Slovakia gave a live broadcast from the square, made invitations with politicians, and the president and prime minister had spectacular speeches that if Cimpel succeeds today, it will move Slovakia into a new era of prosperity.
Although in Slovakia since the morning they have all believed in great success, foreign LSS players were nervous, the current status quo suited them and the eventual success of Cimpel would irreversibly change the balance of power.
The British Prime Minister summoned Avalon players, because Cimpel was already a threat to them and after a successful success, the LSS team of Avalon relegated to the kind of a second  track!
The German chancellor, no one knows how to call him, instructed the WSQ and its community of German-speaking players over the telephony to attack Cimpel after a successful success, weakening him for a few days until a new alliance was reached.
The G7 summit quickly met so that they could react promptly and synchronize their progress, although the truth is that everyone secretly negotiated with Cimpel on possible cooperation and mutual assistance. Cimpel sat in the middle of them with his legs on the table.

He did not listen to quarreling politicians. He knew exactly that he would not change his attitudes and would continue his lily of defiance and loyalty.
But the hour of H was approaching and he had to leave the summit to his tent in the square, right off the stage.
So far, he waited in his tent to go on stage after the president's speech and be able to use all 968 tickets.
The strategy was clearly planned, right after capturing the city, to jump with off Eden. At the beginning to use 30 blue and 30 purple tickets, then switch to a dose of Sx heroes and rhythmically at a fast pace with the thumb of the right hand to give a recruit of 10 doses.

Upon entering the stage, he was greeted by an mobbish crowd of people chanting his name.
It was magnificent, Cimpel indicated with his hands that the crowd would be quiet and that the Slovak national anthem would be played to mark it. During the hymn, the crowd came together as one body and everyone sang the words of the hymn at once.
After the anthem, a festive fanfare sounded and the countdown began.
In the television studios, the analysts recalculated the chances of success and the moderators prepared to comment on the situation.
Cimpel rubbed his hands, pressed his phone tightly. The time has come and he started using tickets rhythmically with his thumb. The first 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 tickets, so far only a few compulsory basic oranges. The fortune generator is slowly approaching the magic number 1000,  is the guarantee of the Sx hero.
60.70.80, tickets, generator stood at 986, fuck, that's on the next 10.
The beginning did not work out, we expected more happiness, but we were also prepared for this alternative.
Another use of tickets is the SX guarantee, people in the square stopped breathing and millions of Slovaks watched the slow motion of Cimpel's thumb on the large screen as they continued to use another 10 tickets.
The moderators commented on the possibilities in one breath.
The 90 tickets used, and just turning over the SX card, it's Glowblade !!!!
Cimpel smiled without losing pace, continued 10, 20, 30 used tickets, 40.50, the scenario began to repeat, the generator of happiness stopped again at 976 and up to the magic 1000 will need another 10 tickets.
Luck does not wish us in this direction, but we cannot believe anything.
90 used tickets and after turning through the TV screens laughing Sx Starburst, there is a slight disappointment, but it can be used in labs to open another skill, so a big plus in the future.
Cimpel continued and used another 10 tickets in a stable rhythm, hoping that the goddess of fortune would smile at him this time. But the goddess of luck, Abbot Cimpel turned his back and the abbot had to use 90 tickets for another SX hero.
Fortunately, it was Abbot Glowblade. The joy of the people is unwritten, they embrace, sing, dance with joy.
The world media immediately filled the headlines "Slovakia is only a step away from becoming a Superpower !!"
