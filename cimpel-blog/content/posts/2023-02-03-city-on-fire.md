<!--StartFragment-->

A snow-covered mountain valley of surrounded by impassable mountains and a picturesque small town in the middle of the central part of the map. The white sausage queen Lene, wrapped in a fur coat, looking into the distance from the terrace of the town hall at the fresh white snow cover, which covered most of the tracks after yesterday's bloody fight. Only the large red seeping bloodstains on the white snow and the snow-covered still smoking skeletons of enemy APCs reminded of yesterday's great heroism of the defenders of the city.\
White snowflakes fall on the alabaster face of Lena,  is trying to catch them it with an open mouth and tongue. The flakes immediately melt on her hot tongue and Lene eagerly swallows them.\
"WTF??" screamed Lene angrily, looking at the big steaming yellow HMB sign written by the swamp in the central courtyard of the city... "Oh sorry, we were celebrating and I drank a lot of beer" he waved his arms at Lene with a laugh Big Sveny pulls up his pants\
\
\
"Your Highness, please come in and sit down by the fireplace so you don't catch a cold," said the butler respectfully, preparing a chair for Lena to sit comfortably by the fireplace.\
Lene stared into the fire and memories of yesterday's fight began to appear in her head.\
A meeting of the HMB guild was taking place in the main town hall. WSQ Lene and R4 of the united alliances, resolved another joint procedure. Maps were laid out on a large table in the shape of a diamond with a large groove in the middle resembling a large vagina from above as a symbol of the birth of the HMB.\
General ViKiRa from the 5zF alliance worriedly expressed his concerns. "enemy wXp has taken the only bridge in the area behind the city and we are cut off from the bases here behind the big mountains! The ancient gate is still guarded by our guild, but yesterday our southern city was attacked by 21K, so we can expect an attack on this strategic city in the heart of enemy territory as well."\
"ViKira is right, we have to strengthen the city's defenses and clear the area around the city  with a one-shot attack in order to increase the defending zone," General Jinu added.\
Lena glanced at the map, beyond the horizon of the big mountains we have many bases ready, we have to declare a state of emergency and be prepared for the worst. "We have to prepare to use the large shield, this will give us enough time to regroup and reset tomorrow and..." Lene didn't have time to finish, because the sound of sirens and loud drumming interrupted her thoughts.\
Enemy Attack on the city, everyone to arms and send a message that all the bases should send APC defenses and especially turn on the Great Shield over the city!" ordered Big Sveny, in charge of the city defence,\
"The shield generators will be active in two hours!" Lethal yelled with panic in his eyes.\
"God help us, everyone to your places!"\
The first enemy APCs hit the unprepared city hard, the ground shook under the onslaught of the attack. And already in the distance the roar of hundreds of engines of incoming enemy APCs could be heard.\
The first defenders were now lined up on the city walls, waiting for the next wave of enemy APCs.\
They knew that they had no chance of surviving, but the honor did not allow them to leave their position and they needed to buy time for the incoming help. "I'm scared," stuttered HansPeter. "We all have fear, it's natural to have fear, but the fact that we will fight against the odds and overcome that damned fear makes us the HMB family." said BC\
    Further waves of enemy attacks destroyed the city wall, whose durability was rapidly decreasing.\
APC's defenses held back a lot of attacks, but big monsters like Maniak with their invincible APC still overcame the defenses and laid waste to the city.\
Despite this, more and more defensive APCs kept pouring into the city to buy time to launch the siege.\
"Felsa, where is Felsa?" shouted Lene "I'm going to his base to find out what's going on"\
Meanwhile, each base sent its apc to defend and stopped the endless rush of attacks with heroic performance for a moment, but the invincible APC with the Pink Girl Outlaw and the Mech pilot with Might 1900 tore at each defender. Despite heavy losses, the HMB heroes rushed to the front line of defense and fought bravely.\
"Felsa, why isn't there a defense of the city, we are under attack?" Lene shouted at Felsa.\
"Oh no I'm just cooking, I don't have time to send the APC" said Felsa embarrassed.\
"WTF???? Do you have to cook right now?" Lene shouted angrily.\
She quickly issued an instruction and herself sent a strong Felsa APC to defend.\
As soon as Fels's APC arrived, the situation stabilized and repelled hundreds of attacks that broke under the force of Fels's APC.\
"We have to hold out for an hour!" Lethal yelled and sent his APC again and again.

Time seemed to stop and every second of the defense lasted for hours, the defenders began to feel tired, but the rush of the enemy's APC  didn't stoped and the fresh reinforcements of 21K began to approach the city.\
"La concha de tu madre! Puta 21K is approaching, we have to surround the city and block the road!" shouted Burzum angrily\
"Zeo mi hermano, will you take care of the road defend in front of 21K?" Burzum asked\
"Hijo de puta I have an important group chat here, I finally found my soulmates, now I can't" answered Zeo.\
"I'll take care of it 21K won't come near the city" Makira said with a smile and sent her APC to block 21K's path.\
"This is how it's done pendejo" said Burzum he caressed with a look lovely ass of the departing Makiri.\
"Oooo Those graceful movements, it's the Italian school of swordplay, only there you'll learn how to move elegantly" Zeo sighed and returned to his conversation with his soul mates.\
Now that it was clear that 21K would not be able to help with the attack on the city and the time until the launch of the city defense was the last 5 minutes, the enemy attacks intensified, every second 50 attacks fell on the city and the city was shaking in its foundations, the durability dropped to 300K and it was still not clear shall we defend the city.\
Because of the thick smoke and heavy clouds of dust, you could no longer see for even a meter, the last seconds of the defense, most of the APCs are already immobile, only a few of the last decimated APCs held the defense when a  shield spread above the city.\
"The city is defended. Glory to HmB, glory to the heroic defenders," shouted the defenders in unison.\
The great joy in the hearts of the HMB spread throughout the guild, but when the dust settled everyone saw the dread. The hospitals in every base were full, crying screams of despair and streams of blood on the streets of the city, and then everyone realized what a sacrifice our heroic players had to make on the altar to win .\
Yesterday was Eden, which will be written down in HmB's chronicle in large letters, and in this way I want to thank every single player who heroically helped with the defense and helped show the whole of Eden that the HmB family is as solid as a rock!!!\
I apologize for not writing about every single person, I would have to write at least a book, because there is an awful lot that happened yesterday.\
Thank you, friends, that I can be a part of this magnificent family
