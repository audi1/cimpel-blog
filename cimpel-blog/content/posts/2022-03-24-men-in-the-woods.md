Floppy was waiting in front of the house for Bacon, who he called to help him, because lately, he had found dead animals on his territory, and some tramps were moving on his land, who had hammered sticks into the ground, supposedly looking for an old Roman road.
Floppy was very nervous about this, so she called Bacon's help to solve these mysteries together or help him fight and hunt !.
It was a nice October day, the fragile rays of the sun were still warm, but the cold north wind was already blowing. Two men were about to enter the dense forest, and one last time they looked around to see if they were really alone.
 Floppy and Bacon stepped carefully so as not to make a noise in the woods. Were they on the hunt to hunt? So far, they didn't know what it would be like. According to the tracks, it could have been a bear, but it could easily have been a wanderer who put their tracks in order to confuse them when tracking ..
The floppy stopped to recover, and when he turned he saw Bacon start undressing.
"WTF, why are you undressing ???" Floppy Bacon shouted.
"It's a very old hunting method of hunting a bear and blending perfectly with the forest."
Bacon answered promptly. "Quickly join too and we will apply this special ointment to our bodies!"
"WHAT?" I can't even think of undressing and rubbing some ointment! Floppy said sharply.
Bacon pretended not to hear him, undressed naked, and began to roughly paint the mysterious ointment.
"It's according to an old deer fat recipe with a mixture of herb glue and wax and bull testicle extract, it protects us from intrusive insects and masks our odor so we don't scare the bear," Bacon explained.
"Fuck, you still have to make some total crap! But I'll give it a try, because I no longer enjoy having fun here!" Floppy said angrily, and he undressed and greased.
"It's quite nice and it's quite warm, and I'm used to the smell," Floppy said.
But after a while of walking in the woods, the ointment began to harden uncomfortably and the cell remained sticky.
The blowing wind spread the fallen leaves of the trees and they stuck to their bodies with the sticky smelly emulsion.

"What the fuck does that mean, I look better on me like an idiot and it all starts to itch, why did I just listen to you?"
"Hold on now, we're invisible in the woods, that's the trick," Bacon said
"Fuck now I see that some of the leaves are shit, someone shit in the woods and wiped the dirty ass on the leaf and now it's blowing on me" Floppy shouted
"And flies are flying at me, they were trying to catch the bird that crashed into me, so I'm full of fucking leaves, insects and prairies !!!" Floppy shouted angrily
"By the way, when we meet the bear, we have to throw shit him in the eye first and then kill him with long spears!"
"What shit where do we get shit?" Floppy said irritably
"when I'll meet bear  we will have shit," Bacon laughed
Our hunters encamped by a nearby small river where they occupied themselves and set fire to spend the night there.
The fire warmed pleasantly and illuminated their naked bodies.
"I'm sorry friend," Bacon said with regret in his voice
"It's okay to know I can't be mad at you," Floppy replied cheerfully.
Bacon couldn't take his eyes off Flopy's lap " o my god he is beautiful, I want to touch him" Bacon whispered
"Don't you dare touch him and stop looking at him!" Floppy said
"I can't help it, I have to pet him," Bacon hissed, touching his gently
"Stop immediately," Floppy said, this is not done among friends, "Flopy added.
Well, Bacon had been stroking him all his length.
"See what you're doing now, you woke him up!" Floppy said angrily. "Stop stroking and kissing him right away!"
A man sat quietly in the tree above them, he was on the tree for hours
The auditor was the Night Watch and often guarded in the treetops when he saw two strange men coming, with leaves, feathers and many insects stuck to him.
He still managed to shit and wipe his ass in the leaves (BTW the leaves then flew on the Floppies), so now he can watch what happens on the tree.
One of the incoming men cursed out loud, they had a camp right under the Audi tree, they smelled unbelievable, so they went to occupy the river immediately. When they came washed out of the Audi River, he immediately met Bacon and Floppy, almost screaming at them, but Something was wrong, why they were naked and in the woods, Audi thought, and finally decided to be quiet and watch. He heard their conversation and saw from the tree that Bacon was bowing his head to Flopy's lap. But Audi wiped it badly in the leaves and its ass was already incredibly itchered, so a third of the branches began to scratch it and the tree began to shake.
"You hear it," Bacon whispered, "someone's in the tree," pointing up
"I hear, we'll jump in three and take up a fighting position," he whispered to the floppy, indicating the direction of the attack.
"And what do we do with him," Bacon asked, glancing at Floppy's lap.
"He's ready now, too," Floppy smiled.
Suddenly they heard a huge crack as the branch broke and a man fell from the tree to the ground.
Floppy, Bacon and Sausage jumped up, Sausage ran loudly, but only for a moment because they met the moaning Audi.
Sausage walks out of the yard, when he saw Floppy and Bacon go into the woods, he followed them all the way, and when they settled up he came to them and fell asleep on Floppy's lap and from which Bacon didn't let him caress and give him a kiss.
So this is the real story of what happened in the forest, no gay orgies but two men and a dog on the hunt and one stalker in the tree.
